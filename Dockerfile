# Production image for vitrine. Build context = this repo (single checkout).
#
# Deployed to vitrine.civitai.com on the Civitai cluster via FluxCD
# (talos-infra). All server env (OAuth creds, DATABASE_URL, S3_*) is injected
# at runtime by the deployment; only NEXT_PUBLIC_* is needed at build time.

# S3_ENDPOINT / S3_PUBLIC_URL are read at BUILD time by next.config.mjs, which
# folds their origins into the CSP connect-src (browser presigned PUT) and
# img-src (uploaded-asset <img>). They must be present during `next build` or
# the baked-in CSP omits the storage host and blocks uploads + asset rendering
# at runtime. Public bucket host only (no secret) — the access key/secret stay
# runtime-injected. Defaults target Backblaze B2 us-west-004.

# devDependencies (drizzle-kit) are kept so the cluster initContainer can run
# migrations before each rollout: `node ./node_modules/drizzle-kit/bin.cjs migrate`.
#
# Placeholder DATABASE_URL for the build only: the db client throws at import if
# unset, but pg's Pool is lazy so no DB is contacted during page-data
# collection. Inline (not ENV) so it never reaches the runtime image.
# SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1 turns off t3-env build-time validation; real server env
# arrives at runtime and fails fast there if missing.
